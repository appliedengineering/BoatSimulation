# Applied Engineering Boat Simulation

### A physics simulation created to find the most optimal configuration for the boat.

## Documentation:
#### Plenty of documentation is found within the code, but here are some important info:
- All units are SI units
- COG = center of gravity
- MOI = moment of inertia
- Be careful to note whether a quaternion is Euler or not, the code makes many conversions
- more to come . . .
